# credit_loan_default_predicting

This is a project that I worked on to get a first view at statistical data visualization using Python as well as to discover better how to address classification problems with
machine learning algortithms available in Python libraries. This was dones using a Kaggle dataset that contained data for customers of a bank. Using information like for example
their gender; level of education; marital status; credit scores etc., I built a machine learning model to predict who of the customers had a higher chance of defaulting in a given
approaching month. Using matplotlib and plotly libraries, I first coded different graphs and figures in order to illustrate some points regarding the customer profiles and to be able
to infer other conclusions in order to later know how to manipulate the data properly. This then gave me quite a lot of information regarding feature importance and gave me ideas for
feature engineering to help optimize the model. 
You will find below the original Kaggle datasets and after finishing this ReadMe can look at the finalized Jupyter Notebook uploaded in this repository.
